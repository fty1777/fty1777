### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm currently a second year CS (computer science) master student in Beihang University. **Looking for PhD positions to start in 2025 Fall.**
- My research interests cover high performance computing, machine learning systems (training/inference optimization), low-level architecture-related performance optimization and performance tools.
- I'm currently working on LLM/LoRA/multimodal inference acceleration and high-performance sparse kernels on both CPU and GPU.
